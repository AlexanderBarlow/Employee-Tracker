# Employee Tracker

## Description
This program solves the need for a CMS that deals with employees in relationship to their department, manager salary and other related data.
We need a system allowed the storage of employee, department and role data within a database that could be changed at any given time. The changes needed to be easy to make along with being able to view the data easily. This is done through the use of inquirer by prompting the user along the way with their requests, whether it is viewing data or changing data.

## Installation
Open up mysql shell and run source schema.sql.
Then run source seeds.sql.
